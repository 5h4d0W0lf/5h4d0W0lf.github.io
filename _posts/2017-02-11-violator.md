Today I'm ready to publish my first walkthrough against the vm hosted on vulnhub called Violator by knightmare.

Starting with this, we can find a few notes on [vulnhub's page](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/violator-1,153/)'s description from Knightmare. 

Those are the informations:

* Vince Clarke can help you with the Fast Fashion.
* The challenge isn’t over with root. The flag is something special.
* I have put a few trolls in, but only to sport with you.

We need to find the vm's ip, so I used netdiscover:
![Net Discover](/assets/violator/netdiscover.png)

Then, as always, I used nmap to discover its open ports:
![IP Scanning](/assets/violator/nmap.png)

The scanning result reveals that the Proftpd 1.3.5rc3 runs on port 21 and Apache httpd 2.4.7 runs on port 80.

I browsed into HTTP server and I saw this: 
![Webserver](/assets/violator/webserver.png)

I found a link for the Violator album's Wikipedia page by the Depeche Mode in webpage's source code. The web server didn't have anything else of interest.

Now we can browse through [exploit-db](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/36742/) and find out if services are exploitable or we have to use searchsploit. I found out that the FTP server is exploitable:
![Searchsploit](/assets/violator/searchsploit.png)

Ok! Now this is interesting because we can use the mod_copy module to read and write files on system:
![Ftp Exploit](/assets/violator/ftp-exploit.png)

Copied successfully!
I navigated on web browser to see interesting files and I found out four users named dg,mg,af and aw:
![Passwd File](/assets/violator/passwd.png)

These usernames are matched with the initials of the Depeche Mode's members. They are Dave Gahan, Martin Gore, Andy Fletcher, and Alan Wilder.

In /etc/group folder I saw that the user dg is a member of several groups, so let's try to crack the passwords of these users. I came back to the wikipedia page the one before, and I tried to catch hot words for the creation of wordlist. Initially I used cewl, for extracting all words from the website and then I used tr and sed commands to create all possible combinations. At the end I launched hydra for cracking the passwords of all users:
![Password Cracking](/assets/violator/password-cracking.png)

With big surprise I found all users' passwords- yup!! :smiley: At this point I connected with dg user and then I uploaded /usr/share/webshells/php/php-reverse-shell.php reverse shell. I updated $ip var in php shell and I launched netcat listener. I spawned bash shell with python, and I logged with dg user. I tried to elevate with sudo command but unsuccessfully.

User dg may run the following commands on violator:

```

With sudo command I saw the proftpd's executable into /home/dg/bd/sbin folder but I decided to come back later on this folder. Navigating into another directories, look what I've just found new interesting files!

```

In mg’s home directory, as you can see, we find "faith_and_devotion" file:

```plaintext
Lyrics:

* Use Wermacht with 3 rotors
* Reflector to B
Initial: A B C
Alphabet Ring: C B A
Plug Board A-B, C-D
```

In aw’s home directory we find "hint" file:

```plaintext
You are getting close... Can you crack the final enigma..?
```

In af’s home directory we find "minarke-1.21" tar.bz2 and its extraction. Minarke is an Enigma M4 emulator and because I've already thought that the faith_and_devotion istructions could be used to decrypt anything, I've downloaded all these files.

I came back in /home/dg/bd/sbin folder, I tried to launch proftpd with sudo command and it seemed that it binded on port 2121 on 127.0.0.1. I telneted to 127.0.0.1 2121 and I found proftpd version 1.3.3c:

```plaintext

I launched uname command to view the current kernel and then I browsed into [exploit-db.com](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/39166/) and I found overlayfs local2root exploit. I uploaded the overlayfail.c in /tmp folder, I compiled it and I launched a.out and BOOOM! I'm the Root! Then I navigated into the Root folder and I found flag.txt and crocs.rar files:

I went back to my local machine and I could see the contents of crocs.rar archive but it was protected by a password. I used rar2john to get the password hash. Then I tried to crack with the wordlist created before:

```plaintext
root@kali:~/Scrivania/reports/violator# rar2john crocs.rar > password.hashes

root@kali:~/Scrivania/reports/violator# john password.hashes --wordlist pass.txt

Our artwork.jpg is, of course, the Violator album cover! Does the image perhaps contain a hidden message?

At this time I tried to use exiftool and it revealed a very suspicious Copyright and Rights message:

At this point I tried to use the minarke previously found but I wasn't be able to make it work, so I googled and I found [this site](http://www.dcode.fr/enigma-machine-cipher) for decrypting enigmas and I used the faith_and_devotion instructions. The final message after decoding looks like this:

```plaintext
ONE FINAL CHALLENGE FOR YOU BGHX CONGRATULATIONS FOR  THE FOURTH TIME ON SNARFING THE FLAG ON VIOLATOR 
I LL PRESUME BY NOW YOU LL KNOW WHAT I WAS LISTENING TO WHEN CREATING THIS CTF I HAVE INCLUDED THINGS WHICH WERE DELIBERATLY AVOIDING THE OBVIOUS ROUTE INTO KEEP YOU ON YOUR TOES ANOTHER THOUGHT TO PONDER IS THAT BY ABUSING PERMISSIONS YOU ARE ALSO BY DEFINITION A VIOLATOR SHOUT OUTS AGAIN TO VULNHUB FOR HOSTING A GREAT LEARNING TOOL A SPECIAL THANKS GOES TO BENR AND GKNSB FOR TESTING AND TO GTMLK FOR THE OFFERT OHOST THE CTF 
AGAIN KNIGHTMARE
```

Awesome! :smiley: Knightmare mentioned in this [tweet](https://twitter.com/knightmare2600/status/752978869767077888) that the final message should be BGH 393X and I think that it is the license plate of a 1981 Ford Corina MkV showed in the [Depeche Mode - Useless](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rDoETo35h0) video.
